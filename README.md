# Smith_Project1
Creates an array of Country objects that are read in from a csv file.
This is my first Data Structures project at UNF. I was very rusty with Java when I wrote this and This is where I believe I started
to understand what I was doing when I was programming. It is not perfect, but it is a stepping stone in my programming journey and I 
am satisfied with how well I did on this project and the future projects for this course.
